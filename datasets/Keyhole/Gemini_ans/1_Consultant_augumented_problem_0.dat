## Expanded Context of the Problem

In advanced laser-material processing, such as laser keyhole welding or additive manufacturing, understanding the physical phenomena governing the formation and stability of the keyhole is crucial. The keyhole is a vapor-filled cavity created by the intense laser beam melting and vaporizing the material. Its geometry, particularly the aspect ratio (depth to width ratio, denoted as \( e^* \)), significantly influences the quality and mechanical properties of the final product.

The keyhole aspect ratio \( e^* \) depends on multiple physical parameters related to the laser and the material:

- **Effective laser power (\(\eta P\))**: The actual power absorbed by the material, accounting for efficiency \(\eta\).
- **Laser scan speed (\(V_s\))**: The velocity at which the laser moves over the material surface.
- **Laser beam radius (\(r_0\))**: The radius of the focused laser spot.
- **Thermal diffusivity (\(\alpha\))**: A measure of how quickly heat spreads through the material.
- **Material density (\(\rho\))**: Mass per unit volume of the material.
- **Heat capacity (\(C_p\))**: The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of the material.
- **Temperature difference (\(T_l - T_0\))**: The difference between the melting temperature and ambient temperature, representing the thermal driving force for melting.

The goal is to perform **dimensional analysis** on these parameters to identify a **dimensionless group** (a combination of these variables raised to certain powers) that best correlates with the keyhole aspect ratio \( e^* \). This dimensionless group should capture the dominant physics controlling the keyhole shape.

The problem requires:

- Reading and processing experimental or simulated data from a CSV file.
- Using dimensional analysis to form candidate dimensionless groups.
- Restricting the exponents to integers or rational fractions, normalized by the laser scan speed exponent, with absolute values not exceeding 3.
- Evaluating the goodness of fit (using \( R^2 \)) of these dimensionless groups against the observed \( e^* \).
- Identifying the optimal dimensionless group that explains the variation in \( e^* \) most effectively.
- Implementing the solution primarily with numpy, scipy, sklearn, pandas, matplotlib, and pytorch, without relying logging.

This problem is a classic example of combining **physics-based modeling** with **data-driven regression** to extract meaningful dimensionless parameters that can guide process optimization and theoretical understanding.

## Multiple Detailed Solution Plans

### Solution Plan 1: Systematic Dimensional Analysis with Integer/Rational Exponents and Linear Regression

**Overview:**  
Use the Buckingham Pi theorem to form dimensionless groups by solving a system of linear equations representing the dimensional constraints. Enumerate possible integer/rational exponents within the specified bounds, generate candidate dimensionless groups, and evaluate their correlation with \( e^* \) using linear regression.

**Steps:**

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Load the CSV file using `pandas`.
   - Extract columns 3,4,5,6,7,8,11 corresponding to \(\eta P, V_s, r_0, \alpha, \rho, C_p, T_l - T_0\).
   - Extract the target variable \( e^* \) from the last column.

2. **Dimensional Units Setup:**
   - Define the fundamental units for each physical quantity (e.g., power in Watts, speed in m/s, radius in m, diffusivity in m²/s, density in kg/m³, heat capacity in J/(kg·K), temperature difference in K).
   - Express each quantity in terms of fundamental dimensions: Mass (M), Length (L), Time (T), Temperature (Θ).

3. **Determine Number of Dimensionless Groups:**
   - Count the number of variables \( n = 7 \).
   - Count the number of fundamental dimensions \( k \) involved (likely 4: M, L, T, Θ).
   - Number of dimensionless groups = \( n - k = 3 \).

4. **Formulate Dimensionless Group:**
   - Represent the dimensionless group as:
     \[
     \Pi = (\eta P)^a (V_s)^b (r_0)^c (\alpha)^d (\rho)^e (C_p)^f (T_l - T_0)^g
     \]
   - The exponents \(a,b,c,d,e,f,g\) must satisfy dimensional homogeneity constraints (linear equations in terms of M, L, T, Θ).

5. **Solve Dimensional Constraints:**
   - Set up a system of linear equations for the exponents to ensure \(\Pi\) is dimensionless.
   - Express some exponents in terms of others to reduce degrees of freedom.

6. **Grid Search for Exponents:**
   - Define a reasonable range for free exponents (e.g., from -3 to 3 in steps of 0.25 or rational fractions like 0, ±1/2, ±1, ±3/2, ±2).
   - For each candidate set of exponents, compute \(\Pi\) for all data points.
   - Fit a simple linear regression model to capture linear relations in the original space \( e^* = m \Pi + c \) or power-law relations via log-transformation \( \log(e^*) = m \log(\Pi) + c \).
   - Compute \( R^2 \) for the fit.

7. **Select Optimal Dimensionless Group:**
   - Identify the exponent set yielding the highest \( R^2 \).
   - Report the dimensionless group and the regression parameters.
   - Print the residuals.

8. **Visualization:**
   - Plot \( e^* \) vs. the optimal \(\Pi\) to visualize correlation.
   - Optionally plot residuals.

**Advantages:**
- Physically interpretable dimensionless groups.
- Exhaustive search ensures global optimum within constraints.
- Simple linear regression is fast and robust.

**Challenges:**
- Combinatorial explosion if not carefully bounded.
- Rational exponents require careful enumeration (e.g., fractions like 1/2, 1/3).

   - Enforce dimensional homogeneity by adding a penalty term \(\|D \cdot \mathbf{x}\|^2\) to the loss.

3. **Exponent Constraints:**
   - To enforce integer/rational exponents and bounds:
     - Use a continuous relaxation during optimization.
     - After optimization, round exponents to nearest allowed rational values.
     - Alternatively, use a custom projection step after each gradient update.
   - Normalize exponents by the exponent of \(V_s\).

4. **Model Definition:**
   - Define the dimensionless group \(\Pi = \prod_i Q_i^{x_i}\) as a differentiable function.
   - Define the loss as mean squared error (MSE) between predicted \( e^* \) (linear or nonlinear function of \(\Pi\)) and actual \( e^* \), plus dimensionality penalty.

5. **Optimization:**
   - Use Adam or LBFGS optimizer to minimize loss.
   - Run multiple initializations to avoid local minima.

6. **Post-processing:**
   - Round exponents to nearest rational numbers within bounds.
   - Recompute \( R^2 \) with rounded exponents.
   - Select the best solution.

7. **Visualization and Reporting:**
   - Plot predicted vs. actual \( e^* \).
   - Report final dimensionless group.

**Advantages:**

### Solution Plan 3: Sparse Regression with Lasso to Identify Dominant Dimensionless Groups

**Overview:**  
Generate a large set of candidate dimensionless groups by combining physical quantities with exponents in the allowed range. Use sparse regression (Lasso) to select the most relevant groups explaining \( e^* \).

**Steps:**

1. **Data Loading:**
   - Same as Plan 1.

2. **Candidate Generation:**
   - Enumerate all possible exponent vectors \(\mathbf{x}\) with integer/rational values normalized by \(V_s\), absolute values \(\leq 3\).
   - For each \(\mathbf{x}\), compute the dimensionless group \(\Pi\).

3. **Feature Matrix Construction:**
   - Construct a feature matrix \(X\) where each column is a candidate \(\Pi\) evaluated over all data points.

4. **Sparse Regression:**
   - Use `sklearn.linear_model.Lasso` to regress \( e^* \) on \(X\).
   - Tune regularization parameter \(\alpha\) to promote sparsity.

5. **Model Selection:**
   - Identify which dimensionless groups have nonzero coefficients.
   - Select the group with the highest coefficient magnitude or best individual \( R^2 \).

6. **Validation:**
   - Cross-validate to avoid overfitting.
   - Plot predicted vs. actual \( e^* \).

**Advantages:**
- Can handle multiple dimensionless groups simultaneously.
- Automatically selects dominant groups.
- Robust to noise and multicollinearity.

**Challenges:**
- Large candidate set may be computationally expensive.
- Interpretation of multiple groups may be complex.

### Solution Plan 4: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on Log-Transformed Data to Identify Dominant Dimensionless Group

**Overview:**  
Since dimensionless groups are products of powers, taking logarithms converts them into linear combinations. Use PCA on the log-transformed physical quantities to find principal components that explain most variance and correlate with \( e^* \).

**Steps:**

1. **Data Loading:**
   - Same as Plan 1.

2. **Log Transformation:**
   - Compute \(\log(Q_i)\) for each physical quantity \(Q_i\).

   - Identify the PC with the highest \( R^2 \).

5. **Interpretation:**
   - The PC corresponds to a dimensionless group with exponents given by the PC loadings.
   - Normalize and round loadings to integer/rational values within bounds.

6. **Validation:**
   - Plot \( e^* \) vs. the identified dimensionless group.
   - Optionally, perform regression on the dimensionless group.

**Advantages:**
