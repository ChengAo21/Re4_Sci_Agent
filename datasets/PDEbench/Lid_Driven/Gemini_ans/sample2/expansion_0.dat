Certainly! Below is an expanded context of the original 2-D steady incompressible Navier-Stokes problem, followed by multiple detailed solution plans focusing on the Artificial Compressibility Method and alternative approaches. Each plan is thorough and specific, suitable for implementation with numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.

---

## Expanded Context of the Problem

The two-dimensional steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations describe the flow of a viscous, incompressible fluid in a domain \(\Omega\). These equations are fundamental in fluid dynamics and model the conservation of momentum and mass. The velocity field \(\mathbf{u} = (u,v)\) and pressure \(p\) satisfy:

\[
\begin{cases}
u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} - \frac{1}{\mathrm{Re}} \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} \right) = 0, \\
u \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial p}{\partial y} - \frac{1}{\mathrm{Re}} \left( \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial y^2} \right) = 0, \\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = 0,
\end{cases}
\quad (x,y) \in \Omega = [0,1]^2,
\]

where \(\mathrm{Re} = 100\) is the Reynolds number, representing the ratio of inertial to viscous forces. The domain is a unit square, a common benchmark geometry for testing numerical methods in fluid mechanics.

### Boundary Conditions

- **Top boundary \(\Gamma_1\):** The velocity is prescribed as a parabolic profile in the \(x\)-direction, \((u,v) = (\alpha x(1-x), 0)\) with \(\alpha=2\). This models a lid-driven cavity flow with a smooth velocity profile, avoiding discontinuities at the corners.
- **Other boundaries \(\Gamma_2\) (left, right, bottom):** No-slip condition \((u,v) = (0,0)\), representing stationary walls.
- **Pressure:** A reference pressure \(p(0,0) = 0\) is set to fix the pressure level, since pressure is determined up to a constant in incompressible flows.
- **Zero normal pressure gradient:** \(\frac{\partial p}{\partial n} = 0\) on \(\partial \Omega\), ensuring no artificial pressure flux through the boundaries.

### Physical and Numerical Challenges

- The problem is nonlinear due to convective terms \(u \partial_x u\), \(v \partial_y u\), etc.
- The incompressibility constraint \(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0\) couples velocity and pressure fields tightly.
- The Reynolds number \(Re=100\) is moderate, allowing for laminar flow but with nontrivial vortical structures.
- Numerical methods must handle the saddle-point nature of the system and ensure stability and convergence.

## Multiple Detailed Solution Plans

### Plan 1: Artificial Compressibility Method (ACM) with Finite Differences

**Overview:**  
The Artificial Compressibility Method introduces a pseudo-time derivative of pressure to relax the incompressibility constraint, converting the steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations into a time-dependent system that can be marched to steady state.

**Key Steps:**

1. **Reformulate the system:**

   Introduce artificial compressibility parameter \(\beta\) and pseudo-time \(\tau\):

   \[
   \frac{\partial p}{\partial \tau} + \beta \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0,
   \]

   and solve the unsteady system:

   \[
   \begin{cases}
   \frac{\partial u}{\partial \tau} + u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} - \frac{1}{Re} \Delta u = 0, \\
   \frac{\partial v}{\partial \tau} + u \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial p}{\partial y} - \frac{1}{Re} \Delta v = 0, \\
   \frac{\partial p}{\partial \tau} + \beta \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \right) = 0.
   \end{cases}
   \]

2. **Discretization:**

   - Use a uniform grid on \([0,1]^2\) with spacing \(h\).
   - Approximate spatial derivatives with second-order central finite differences.
   - Use explicit or semi-implicit time stepping in pseudo-time \(\tau\).
   - Choose \(\beta\) to balance convergence speed and stability (e.g., \(\beta = 1\)).

3. **Boundary conditions:**

   - Enforce velocity boundary conditions directly at boundary nodes.
   - For pressure, fix \(p(0,0) = 0\) and apply zero normal pressure gradient using Neumann conditions.
   
4. **Algorithm:**

   - Initialize \(u,v,p\) fields (e.g., zero velocity, zero pressure).
   - March in pseudo-time until residuals (e.g., divergence norm) fall below tolerance.
   - At each step, update \(u,v,p\) using discretized equations.
   
5. **Post-processing:**

   - Compute velocity magnitude \(\sqrt{u^2 + v^2}\).
   - Plot contours of velocity magnitude with streamlines using matplotlib.
   - Use `jet` colormap for contours.
   - Save figure to file.

**Advantages:**

- Simple to implement with finite differences.
- Avoids solving saddle-point system directly.
- Suitable for structured grids.

**Potential Challenges:**

- Stability constraints on pseudo-time step.
- Artificial compressibility parameter tuning.
- Slow convergence for high Reynolds numbers.

### Plan 2: Artificial Compressibility Method with Finite Volume Discretization

**Overview:**  
Use a finite volume method (FVM) to discretize the equations, which conserves fluxes naturally and handles complex geometries better.

**Key Steps:**

1. **Grid and control volumes:**

   - Use a uniform Cartesian grid.
   - Define control volumes centered at grid points.

2. **Discretization:**

   - Integrate governing equations over control volumes.
   - Approximate convective fluxes using upwind or QUICK schemes for stability.
   - Diffusive terms discretized with central differences.
   - Pressure gradient and divergence terms discretized consistently.

3. **Artificial compressibility:**

   - Same as Plan 1, introduce pseudo-time pressure evolution.
   - March in pseudo-time to steady state.

4. **Boundary conditions:**

   - Implement velocity boundary conditions as Dirichlet on control volume faces.
   - Pressure boundary conditions as Neumann or fixed reference.

5. **Solution algorithm:**

   - Use explicit or implicit time stepping.
   - Possibly use SIMPLE or PISO algorithms adapted with artificial compressibility.

6. **Post-processing:**

   - Same as Plan 1.

**Advantages:**

- Better conservation properties.
- More flexible for complex geometries.
- Can handle convection-dominated flows better with upwind schemes.

**Challenges:**

- More complex implementation than finite differences.
- Requires careful flux discretization.

### Plan 3: Artificial Compressibility Method with Spectral or Pseudo-Spectral Methods

**Overview:**  
Use spectral methods (e.g., Fourier or Chebyshev expansions) to discretize spatial derivatives, achieving high accuracy for smooth solutions.

**Key Steps:**

1. **Domain and basis:**

   - Use Chebyshev polynomials or Fourier series on \([0,1]^2\).
   - Map boundary conditions accordingly.

2. **Discretization:**

   - Represent \(u,v,p\) as sums of basis functions.
   - Compute derivatives spectrally.
   - Implement artificial compressibility time stepping.

3. **Boundary conditions:**

   - Enforce velocity boundary conditions strongly or via penalty methods.
   - Pressure reference and Neumann conditions handled in spectral space.

4. **Time stepping:**

   - Use explicit or implicit schemes in pseudo-time.
   - Possibly use operator splitting.

5. **Post-processing:**

   - Transform spectral coefficients back to physical space.
   - Plot velocity magnitude and streamlines.

**Advantages:**

- Very high accuracy for smooth problems.
- Efficient for moderate grid sizes.

**Challenges:**

- Complex implementation.
- Handling non-periodic boundary conditions.
- Aliasing errors and dealiasing required.

### Plan 4: Alternative Approach - Projection Method (for comparison)

**Overview:**  
Although the user requested Artificial Compressibility, the Projection Method is a classical alternative to solve incompressible Navier-Stokes.

**Key Steps:**

1. **Split velocity update and pressure correction:**

   - Compute intermediate velocity ignoring pressure.
   - Solve Poisson equation for pressure correction.
   - Correct velocity to enforce divergence-free condition.

2. **Discretization:**

   - Use finite differences on uniform grid.
   - Time stepping in pseudo-time or physical time.

3. **Boundary conditions:**

   - Velocity Dirichlet on boundaries.
   - Pressure Neumann or Dirichlet as needed.

4. **Post-processing:**

   - Same as above.

**Advantages:**

- Well-established and robust.
- Decouples velocity and pressure solves.

**Challenges:**

- Requires solving Poisson equation at each step.
- More computationally expensive per iteration.
