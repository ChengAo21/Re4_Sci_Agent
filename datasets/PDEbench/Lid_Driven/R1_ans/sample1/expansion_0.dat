Certainly! Below is an expanded context of the original 2D steady incompressible Navier-Stokes problem, followed by multiple detailed solution plans using numerical methods and Python libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib) as requested.

## Expanded Context of the Problem

The two-dimensional steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations describe the flow of a viscous, incompressible fluid in a domain \(\Omega\). These equations are fundamental in fluid dynamics and model the conservation of momentum and mass for fluid flow. The system consists of:

- **Momentum equations** in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions, which balance convective acceleration, pressure gradient forces, and viscous diffusion.
- **Continuity equation** enforcing incompressibility (divergence-free velocity field).

Mathematically, the PDE system is:

\[
\begin{cases}
u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} - \frac{1}{\mathrm{Re}} \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} \right) = 0, \\
u \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial p}{\partial y} - \frac{1}{\mathrm{Re}} \left( \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial y^2} \right) = 0, \\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = 0,
\end{cases}
\quad (x,y) \in \Omega = [0,1]^2.
\]

Here, \(u(x,y)\) and \(v(x,y)\) are the velocity components in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions, respectively, and \(p(x,y)\) is the pressure field. The Reynolds number \(\mathrm{Re}\) characterizes the ratio of inertial to viscous forces and is set to 100, indicating moderate flow regime where both convection and diffusion are significant.

### Boundary Conditions

- On the **top boundary** \(\Gamma_1\) (i.e., \(y=1\)), a parabolic velocity profile is imposed in the \(x\)-direction: 
  \[
  (u,v) = (\alpha x(1-x), 0), \quad \alpha=2.
  \]
  This models a lid-driven flow with a smooth velocity profile.
  
- On the **left, right, and bottom boundaries** \(\Gamma_2\), no-slip conditions are applied:
  \[
  (u,v) = (0,0).
  \]

- The pressure is anchored by setting a reference value at the bottom-left corner:
  \[
  p(0,0) = 0,
  \]
  to ensure uniqueness of the pressure solution.

### Physical and Computational Significance

- The problem models a classical lid-driven cavity flow, a benchmark in computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
- The flow is steady-state, so time derivatives vanish.
- The incompressibility constraint couples the velocity components and pressure.
- The moderate Reynolds number requires careful numerical treatment to capture convection-diffusion balance.
- The domain is a unit square, facilitating uniform grid discretization.

## Multiple Detailed Solution Plans

### Plan 1: Finite Difference Method (FDM) with SIMPLE Algorithm

u \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial y} = \frac{1}{\mathrm{Re}} \left( \frac{\partial^2 \omega}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \omega}{\partial y^2} \right), \\
\omega = -\left( \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial y^2} \right).
\end{cases}
\]
