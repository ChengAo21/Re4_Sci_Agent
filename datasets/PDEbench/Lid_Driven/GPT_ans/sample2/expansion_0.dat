Certainly! Let's first expand the context of the given 2D steady incompressible Navier-Stokes problem, then provide multiple detailed solution algorithms using the specified Python libraries.

---

## Expanded Context of the Problem

The Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of fluid substances such as liquids and gases. In two dimensions, the steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations model the velocity field \((u,v)\) and pressure \(p\) of a fluid flow that does not change with time and has constant density. The equations consist of momentum conservation in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions and the incompressibility condition (mass conservation).

### Physical and Mathematical Background

- **Domain \(\Omega = [0,1]^2\):** A unit square domain representing a simplified 2D flow region.
- **Boundary Conditions:**
  - On the top boundary \(\Gamma_1\), a parabolic velocity profile \((u,v) = (\alpha x(1-x), 0)\) is imposed, simulating a lid-driven flow with a smooth velocity distribution.
  - On the other boundaries \(\Gamma_2\) (left, right, bottom), no-slip conditions \((u,v) = (0,0)\) are applied, representing stationary walls.
- **Reynolds Number \(Re=100\):** A dimensionless parameter characterizing the ratio of inertial to viscous forces. Moderate Reynolds number implies laminar but non-trivial flow with possible vortices.
- **Reference Pressure:** \(p(0,0) = 0\) fixes the pressure level to remove the arbitrary constant in pressure solutions.
- **Governing PDEs:**
  - Nonlinear convection terms \(u \partial_x u + v \partial_y u\) and \(u \partial_x v + v \partial_y v\) represent fluid inertia.
  - Pressure gradient terms \(\partial_x p\), \(\partial_y p\) drive the flow.
  - Diffusion terms \(\frac{1}{Re} \Delta u\), \(\frac{1}{Re} \Delta v\) model viscous dissipation.
  - Continuity equation \(\partial_x u + \partial_y v = 0\) enforces incompressibility.

### Scientific and Engineering Relevance

- This problem is a classical benchmark for numerical methods solving Navier-Stokes equations.
- It models lid-driven cavity flow, a canonical problem in fluid mechanics used to validate CFD codes.
- Understanding flow patterns, vortex formation, and pressure distribution is critical in engineering applications such as aerodynamics, microfluidics, and HVAC systems.
