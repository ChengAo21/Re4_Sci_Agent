# Technical explanation for the solving algorithm:
# This code implements a Finite Volume Method (FVM) to solve the 1D Euler equations,
# which describe the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy for compressible,
# inviscid fluid flow. The FVM approach ensures conservation by integrating the
# equations over discrete control volumes (cells) and computing fluxes at cell interfaces.
#
# The core of this solver is the HLLC (Harten-Lax-van Leer-Contact) approximate Riemann solver.
# The Euler equations are a system of hyperbolic conservation laws, and discontinuities
# (like shocks and contact discontinuities) can form. A Riemann solver is used at each
# cell interface to determine the numerical flux, which represents the flow of conserved
# quantities between cells.
#
# The HLLC solver is chosen for its balance of accuracy and computational efficiency.
# It approximates the solution to the Riemann problem by assuming a three-wave structure:
# a left-going wave (speed SL), a right-going wave (speed SR), and a contact discontinuity
# (speed S_star) in between. Unlike the simpler HLL solver, HLLC explicitly resolves
# the contact discontinuity, leading to sharper resolution of these features.
#
# The steps involved in the HLLC solver are:
# 1. Convert conserved variables (density, momentum, total energy) to primitive variables
#    (density, velocity, pressure) for both left and right states at an interface.
# 2. Calculate the speed of sound for both states.
# 3. Estimate the left (SL) and right (SR) wave speeds. These are typically chosen as
#    the minimum and maximum characteristic speeds (eigenvalues of the flux Jacobian)
#    from the left and right states.
# 4. Calculate the contact wave speed (S_star) and the pressure in the star region (p_star)
#    using jump conditions across the waves.
# 5. Based on the signs of SL, S_star, and SR, determine which region of the Riemann fan
#    the interface falls into.
# 6. Compute the numerical flux (F_HLLC) using the appropriate state (left, right, or
#    one of the two star states separated by the contact discontinuity).
#
# The time integration is performed using a second-order Runge-Kutta (SSP-RK2) scheme.
# This scheme improves temporal accuracy and stability compared to the first-order
# explicit Euler scheme, which was identified as a potential source of instability.
# SSP-RK2 involves two stages of flux computation and updates, ensuring better preservation
# of solution properties.
#
# Spatial reconstruction is enhanced using a second-order MUSCL (Monotonic Upstream-centered
# Scheme for Conservation Laws) approach with a Minmod slope limiter. This is crucial for
# reducing numerical diffusion and achieving sharper resolution of discontinuities (shocks,
# contact discontinuities, rarefactions) compared to a first-order scheme. The primitive
# variables (rho, u, p) are reconstructed at cell interfaces, which is generally more robust
# than reconstructing conserved variables.
#
# The time step (dt) is determined by the CFL (Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy) condition to ensure
# numerical stability, based on the maximum characteristic speed in the domain.
#
# Boundary conditions are handled using zero-order extrapolation (transmissive) for ghost cells.
# For a second-order spatial scheme (like MUSCL), 2 ghost cells are typically required on each side.
#
# The simulation proceeds by repeatedly:
# 1. Applying boundary conditions to ghost cells.
# 2. Calculating numerical fluxes at all cell interfaces using the HLLC solver, with
#    interface states reconstructed by MUSCL.
# 3. Updating the conserved variables in each cell using the SSP-RK2 time integration formula.
# 4. Enforcing positivity constraints on conserved variables (density and total energy)
#    after each update to maintain physical validity and numerical stability.
# 5. Incrementing time and adjusting the time step.
#
# Finally, the conserved variables are converted back to primitive variables for plotting
# density, velocity, and pressure at the specified final time.
