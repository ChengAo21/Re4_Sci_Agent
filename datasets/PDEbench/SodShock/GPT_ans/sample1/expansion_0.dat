**Expanded Context:**

The Euler equations describe the conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy for an inviscid compressible fluid flow. They form a system of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) that are fundamental in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The system is given by:

\[
\begin{cases}
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial (\rho u)}{\partial x} = 0, \\
\frac{\partial (\rho u)}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial (\rho u^2 + p)}{\partial x} = 0, \\
\frac{\partial (\rho E)}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial (\rho E u + p u)}{\partial x} = 0,
\end{cases}
\]

where \(\rho\) is the density, \(u\) is the velocity, \(p\) is the pressure, and \(E\) is the total specific energy defined as

\[
E = \frac{1}{2} u^2 + \frac{p}{(\gamma - 1) \rho},
\]

with \(\gamma = 1.4\) representing the ratio of specific heats for air (ideal diatomic gas).

The problem is posed on the spatial domain \(x \in [0,1]\) with a discontinuous initial condition (a Riemann problem):

\[
(\rho, u, p) = 
\begin{cases}
(1.0, 0.0, 1.0), & 0 < x \leq 0.5, \\
(0.125, 0.0, 0.1), & 0.5 \leq x < 1,
\end{cases}
\]

which models a shock tube problem (Sod shock tube). The goal is to solve the Euler equations numerically up to time \(t=0.2\) and plot the resulting density, velocity, and pressure profiles.

This problem is a classical benchmark for testing numerical methods for hyperbolic conservation laws because it involves shock waves, contact discontinuities, and rarefaction waves. The numerical method must be able to capture these features accurately without introducing spurious oscillations or excessive numerical diffusion.

**Detailed Solution Plans:**

---

### Plan 1: Finite Volume Method with Roe's Approximate Riemann Solver

**Overview:**
- Use a finite volume discretization on a uniform grid.
- Compute numerical fluxes at cell interfaces using Roe's approximate Riemann solver.
- Update conserved variables using explicit time stepping (e.g., forward Euler or Runge-Kutta).
- Use a CFL condition to determine the time step.
- Reconstruct primitive variables from conserved variables for plotting.

**Key Steps:**
1. Discretize the domain into \(N\) cells.
2. Initialize \(\rho, u, p\) and compute conserved variables \(\mathbf{U} = [\rho, \rho u, \rho E]^T\).
3. At each time step:
   - Compute fluxes \(\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{U})\).
   - Compute Roe averages and eigenvalues at interfaces.
   - Calculate Roe fluxes.
   - Update \(\mathbf{U}\) using finite volume update formula.
4. Enforce boundary conditions (e.g., transmissive or reflective).
5. After reaching \(t=0.2\), convert \(\mathbf{U}\) back to \(\rho, u, p\).
6. Plot results.

**Advantages:**
- Captures shocks and contact discontinuities sharply.
- Well-established and robust for Euler equations.

**Challenges:**
- Implementation of Roe solver requires careful eigen-decomposition.
- May require entropy fix to avoid non-physical expansion shocks.

### Plan 2: Finite Volume Method with HLLC Riemann Solver

**Overview:**
- Similar to Plan 1 but use the HLLC (Harten-Lax-van Leer-Contact) approximate Riemann solver.
- HLLC is simpler to implement than Roe and preserves contact discontinuities better than HLL.

**Key Steps:**
1. Same domain discretization and initialization as Plan 1.
2. At each interface, compute wave speeds \(S_L, S_R, S_*\) using estimates based on local states.
3. Compute HLLC fluxes using these wave speeds.
4. Update conserved variables with finite volume update.
5. Apply boundary conditions.
6. Convert to primitive variables and plot.

**Advantages:**
- Robust and positivity preserving.
- Captures contact discontinuities well.
- Easier to implement than Roe.

**Challenges:**
- Slightly more diffusive than Roe in some cases.
- Requires careful wave speed estimation.

### Plan 3: Finite Difference Method with Flux Splitting (e.g., Steger-Warming)

**Overview:**
- Use a finite difference scheme on a uniform grid.
- Split flux into positive and negative parts based on eigenvalues.
- Use upwind differencing for each flux component.
- Time integration with explicit Runge-Kutta.

**Key Steps:**
1. Initialize grid and variables.
2. Compute flux splitting: \(\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{F}^+ + \mathbf{F}^-\).
3. Use upwind finite difference for \(\mathbf{F}^+\) and \(\mathbf{F}^-\).
4. Update conserved variables.
5. Apply boundary conditions.
6. Convert to primitive variables and plot.

**Advantages:**
- Conceptually simpler than Riemann solvers.
- Good for smooth flows and moderate shocks.

**Challenges:**
- More diffusive near discontinuities.
- May require limiters or artificial viscosity.

### Plan 4: Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) Method with Local Lax-Friedrichs Flux

**Overview:**
- Use a high-order DG method for spatial discretization.
- Use Local Lax-Friedrichs (Rusanov) flux at element interfaces.
- Time integration with strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta (SSP-RK).

**Key Steps:**
1. Partition domain into elements.
2. Represent solution in each element by polynomial basis.
3. Compute numerical fluxes at interfaces using Rusanov flux.
4. Compute volume integrals and update coefficients.
5. Apply boundary conditions weakly.
6. After time stepping, reconstruct solution and plot.

**Advantages:**
- High-order accuracy.
- Good for complex geometries and adaptive refinement.
- Well-suited for parallelization.

**Challenges:**
- More complex implementation.
- Requires careful treatment of limiters to avoid oscillations near shocks.

### Plan 5: Neural Network Based Solver Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

**Overview:**
- Use PyTorch to implement a PINN that approximates the solution \((\rho, u, p)\).
- Define loss functions based on residuals of Euler equations and initial/boundary conditions.
- Train the network to minimize residuals over the domain and time interval.

**Key Steps:**
1. Define a neural network with inputs \((x,t)\) and outputs \((\rho, u, p)\).
2. Compute \(E\) and conserved variables inside the network.
3. Define PDE residuals using automatic differentiation.
4. Define initial condition loss and boundary condition loss.
5. Train network using Adam or LBFGS optimizer.
6. Evaluate trained network at \(t=0.2\) and plot results.

**Advantages:**
- Mesh-free method.
- Can handle complex geometries and parameter variations.
- Provides continuous solution representation.

**Challenges:**
- Training can be computationally expensive.
- Accuracy and convergence depend on network architecture and training strategy.
- Less mature for sharp discontinuities like shocks.
